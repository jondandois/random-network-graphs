# random-network-graphs
playing around with canvas and creating random graphs of connectivity

## Getting started
Load the page and click `Generate random set of connected organizations` to populate the canvas with N random locations that each have randomly assigned one-way connections.  Change the number in the input box to create a graph with more or less dots.

### Entering custom values
You can also map your own values.  In the `Locations` text area, enter different entities and their x,y coordinates in the format `entity_name: x, y`. For now, please keep the coordinate values from 0-500 (more mapping will be supported later).

Then, in the `Associations` section, enter a list of associations for each entity defined in the `Locations` section.  The names all need to match!  Follow the pattern from the example random data for best results.
